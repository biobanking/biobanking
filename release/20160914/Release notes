Release notes for 20160914
Terms needed for OBIB were of sufficient interest to OBI for inclusion there and are imported for this release. 
The terms included those for specimen containers, relating collected specimens, and specimens from organism ('tissue specimens').
The import led to duplication of some terms (https://github.com/biobanking/biobanking/issues/17) originating from OMIABIS. 
After checking with the MIABIS 2.0 group, those terms were made obsolete (relabeled, moved under ObsoleteClass).
'term replaced by' annotation property points to the new terms. 
An evaluation of OBIB was performed using HL7DAM-CDISC use case 1 and 4 additional terms were added for full coverage of that use case.
The list of terms imported is in https://github.com/biobanking/biobanking/issues/15
Also included were related terms from UBERON defining anatomic derivation of specimens.
