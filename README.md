Ontology for Biobanking (OBIB)
==========

The Ontology for Biobanking (OBIB) is an ontology for the annotation and modeling of the activities, contents, and administration of a biobank. Biobanks are facilities that store specimens, such as bodily fluids and tissues, typically along with specimen annotation and clinical data. OBIB is based on a subset of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI), has the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its upper ontology, and is developed following OBO Foundry principles. The first version of OBIB resulted from the merging of two existing biobank-related ontologies, OMIABIS and biobank ontology.

The source code of the ontology is under src directory:
   * obib_dev.owl : developmental version of OBIB for editing
   * obib.owl : latest release file of OBIB
   * imports/ : directory contains obib_dev.owl imported OWL files
   * external/ : directory contains ontodog, ontofox input files used to retrieve terms from OBO Foundry ontologies

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at: [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obib.owl](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obib.owl)
